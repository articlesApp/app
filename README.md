<h1> The Articles App </h1>

There's noise. Between me and the information I desire.
There's fog. A fog of preferences of my dear friends, which shapes what I get to read.
There's opinions. An opinion on everything, a vote, a comment, a reaction, that I have to see along with the heading.

I am shaped by what I read. What I read is shaped by the above 3. We are building this app, to calm things down.
To bring focus to information. To leave the discussion for those who wish to, where they wish to. For here, I serve
only one purpose, I make only one attempt:

To help share among us the information we desire.
